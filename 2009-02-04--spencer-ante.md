*Spencer E. Ante, BusinessWeek editor and author, quotes excerpts from his book,Creative Capital: Georges Doriot and the Birth of Venture Capital, and offers a historical portal into the start and evolution of venture capital. He draws an investment timeline starting with the post-WWII economy, delves into the dominance of Silicon Valley, and discusses current recessionary activity.*

“The university does not look down on economic aspirations”. Venture capital was created on the East Coast in 1946. Dorios was the first guy to raise money from non-family sources. Believed in the future of financing entrepreneurs in a formalized way.

“Our animal spirits are repressed, we have to find a way to revive them”. They say that the Silicon Valley is dead. The tax reform of 1932 doubled the estate tax, successive reforms in 1935 and 1937. In 1936, the financial community woke up to the situation, and at MIT said the law in some cases actually went against technological advancement. More and more money was coming into insurance and pension funds.

In 1938, at MIT: “altough capital exists for new ventures, there is a need for organization and a technique for appraisal of specific enterprises.” The WW2 broke out, and they realized that a venture capital company should have enough capital to be independent of external factors. After the great depression, the government was really focused on the big, and overlooked the small agents.

During the war, Doriot learned how to be a venture capitalist by becoming a brigadier. He applied science and technology to war: bulletproof armor, for example. Their first homerun is Digital Equipment Corporation. It was the first time people realized you could make incredible amount of money (7000% return). When he was about to take DEC public (1966), no one at Lehman had any interest in dealing with microcomputers.
It was mind-blowing that which such small amount of money you could take ownership of a company worth so much (for a short period of time, DEC was valued more than IBM).
Doriot was the first to believe that there was a future to financing entrepreneurs in an organized way.

The author feels that now VCs are more like care-takers or pension fund managers.

Financial results are a byproduct of part labour, not the end goal.

The public really became familiar with VC with biotech in the 1980, when the company ? managed to synthesize human growth hormone. Biotech, computers, and technology provided the rocket fuel for the boom in the 1980s.

One of the innovations going on in venture capital right now is microcap, small funds of about $20m.

“After we get out of this, there’s gonna be a new normal. We’re not gonna have a lot of capital in a long time.”
