Charisma is the result of specific behaviors. They fall into 3 categories:

- presence
- power
- warmth

"Don't try to impress them, let them impress you." Story about the two British Prime Minister candidates in the Victorian era.

Power is our impression of your ability to change the world around you. We look for clues in impression and body language and others' reactions.

You don't try to change the output (the body language) but rather the input (the mind).

For your brain there is no difference between imagination and reality.

Experiments in which participants were asked to look into each other's eyes reported increased affection.

To create warmth, you can think about person you are affectionate about. This will show through as authentic warmth. For a difficult person, try the following:

- think about their past, their difficult childhood
- think about their present, imagine a difficult situation they may be going through. Again, the brain can't tell between reality and imagination.

You really want to feel the emotions you want to portray.
