*MARC ANDREESSEN is an entrepreneur, investor, startup coach, blogger, and a software engineer best known as co-author of Mosaic, the first widely-used web browser, and founder of Netscape Communications Corporation. He was the chair of Opsware, a software company he founded originally as Loudcloud, when it was acquired by Hewlett-Packard. He is also a co-founder of Ning, a company which provides a platform for social-networking websites. As of June 30, 2008, he is said to be joining the Board of Directors of Facebook. On September 30, 2008, it was announced that he had joined the Board of Directors of eBay, and September 17, 2009 it was announced he had been named to the board of HP. *

He’s looking for at least 10x improvements with respect to the current technology. Market sizing is very important, otherwise people start to get demotivated.

He’s not looking for people who are able to run a 500 people business, but those who can ship a working product in a big market.

Most of the successful software franchises of the past decades have been products that became companies, not the other way around. “Product that becomes a company” is a good template because it shows that that product needs to exist. The other way around, he has seen groups of smart entrepreneurs getting together to build a company and fooling themselves that a need exists, when it just isn’t there.

About newspaper companies: they say they don’t focus much on digital because paper still brings the lion share of revenues. But for these big companies, revenues are basically correlated with attention (and investment). He suggests they shut down the presses to change the cost structure (and reduce overhead) so that digital will become profitable as well. He is very experienced with this process, because in the technology world, when the technology changes, everything changes. Other sectors are not so used to this. An example is Intel: they decided to shut down the memory business to focus on CPUs. Media companyies, on the other hand are not used to this. The new media companies are structured well for the internet, a completely different kind of energy.
He predicts a new wave of consumer electronics coming from the U.S., as there is a lot more software going into those things compared to decades ago. The hardware is commoditized nowadays.

##QA

Do you see new cloud providers help startups reduce their startup cost?
All companies building companies now are building on AWS.

Nowadays most sites are ad-supported. With the rise in user-generated content, do you foresee a way of sharing revenues with authors?
Many people tried to, but no attempt has been successful until now. People are motivated by contribution, not by greed. This is a puzzle for economists, just like Wikipedia.

He doesn’t think there exists such a thing as the venture capital industry, as the access to information is so restricted that a small number of firms reaps all the returns and the others are mediocre at best. People say that venture capital sucks, and this is true if you include the bad-performing firms. And entrepreneurs know this.

Companies are going public later and later, and there is a new class of investors who take up large ownership stakes (100mln or more).

As an investor, he prefers product that half of the people love, and the other half hates.
Product that become companies have an higher valuations because there’s already something running. The best thing you can do for fund-raising is building a prototype (or the product itself).

A pro of venture capital is the long lock-in period. You have 15 years in which you get to do what you want, very unlike an hedge fund in which your performance gets reviewed every day.
