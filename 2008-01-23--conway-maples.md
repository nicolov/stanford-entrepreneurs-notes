#2008-01-23 Ron Conway and Mike Maples

*Experienced angel investors, Ron Conway, Founder of Angel Investors LP, and Mike Maples, Founder of Maples Investments, provide a rare look into the ins and outs of angel investing. Conway and Maples discuss how angel investors assess opportunities, provide assistance to entrepreneurs and transition start-ups to larger venture investments or exit. In addition, Conway and Maples provide advice to entrepreneurs about finding one's passion and developing that passion into new ventures, including insight into how much money to raise and how to manage that money after it is in the bank.*

Four main reasons to have an angel investor: money, contacts, experience and a broader chance of exit options (raising little money and keeping the burn rate low). Mike thinks a new form is angel is coming up. A traditional angel would invest 50/100k, a VC a couple of millions. The new angel sits in the middle. Ideas are pretty cheap. If you come to an investor and have done no experiment, it reflects a lot about the entrepreneur. the one common mistake “They want to have lunch to just to talk about ideas. What the heck I know if it’s a good idea, I’m not a customer. My opinion is irrelevant if I’m not going to pay for the product, only customers matter in terms of evaluating if it’s a good idea”.

The main angel will go and syndicate the rest of the round. A bit like Ocean’s 11. In early stages is staffing up, either in engineering talent or biz dev. Later, if it’s a capital intensive company, set a meeting with the VC, or else do another round with angels.
He makes sure he only has one inexperienced entrepreneur at any single time, otherwise the workload is too great.

How do you build a portfolio of investments? Monetization of video is a great opportunity. It’s still the early days of search. Behavioural targeting, delivering better advertising. Gaming. Receives around 5 pitches per day, 3 are rejected right away.

The first time investment I made was in Audio, a company started by Evan Williams who previously started Blogger. It was about podcasts, I thought they were going to be huge. The week after, Apple announces podcasting in iTunes. 6 months later, Evan says he doesn’t have a real business and wanted to give the money back. I don’t want the money back, just put it in whatever you’re starting next. I have this exciting side-project called Twitter. It’s not the entrepreneur that failed, it was the business that failed. Not have anybody take it personally. Pick flexibile people who understand their business is going to morph.

How long of a runway do you give people? After how long do you re-evaluate? Companies with a low burn-rate have a much greater possibility of getting something working. “There’s no other rule other than keeping the burn rate low”. Companies are the most productive when you’re less than 10 people. With the first million dollar, you want 6 people, and everyone works their ass off.

Most companies in the SV when you ask for their roadmap, they talk about an engineering program.
the brave new world of entrepreneurship “Low burn experimentation done a lot, find out the winning answers, discard the losing answers”

Every week, we send VCs a letter with companies entering the funding cycle in 30 days, and another list for companies looking for funding in 30-90 days. Entrepreneurs who deliver on deadlines have no problems raising money. If you deliver something dramatic and have 6 months left of money, you send a message of strength.

We can’t find CEOs who want to work for less than 300k/y. The ecosystem anywhere else is nothing close. What’s the one thing you’ve learned? Draw a 25 mile radius around Stanford University and 75% of all return in the venture business will come from there”.

“There are a lot of listeners outside Silicon Valley” “Get on the plane”. In Europe, lawyers screw up all the docs.
“I never liked managing other people’s money. I don’t want to be a fiduciary.” This makes me a lot more productive.

##QA

Would you invest in an energy company? I believe that if an idea is really disruptive, it is capital efficiency. The way I look at it is I specialize in capital efficiency, a part of the capital ecosystem which I think is underserver.

Any advice for young entrepreneurs? If you have an idea, hopefully it is an idea that satisfies a need that you encounter yourself, the youtube test.

There are almost no company without a co-founder. Most startups have 2-3 people. 

	“You are at Stanford university, you have the rare possibility to do whatever you want in life. Anybody who comes out of this experience without doing what they’re excited about, it’s a tragedy of their own making.

How will the world look like in 20 years? I specialize in 3-4 years. Search of today will look like it’s crap. Many sites will be video-only.

I have enough money now that I just want to watch the entrepreneur excel and succeed.
Most decisions are either 50/50 or obvious. If its’ 49/51, it doesn’t matter which you pick. If it’s 70/30 it’s clear. It’s surprising how you already know the answer and you just need to give you permission to do the thing you know is the right thing. Commit yourself to doing exceptional work always, and being around people who have that ethic. If you do those two things, odds are that you’ll end up ok.
