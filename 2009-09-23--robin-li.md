*Robin Li, CEO of Baidu, speaks in detail about the launch and growth of the company and the search engine. He discusses how its intimate understanding of Chinese language and culture - and a unique social approach to search - have allowed it to succeed where many North American search giants have faltered.*

Founder of baidu, 70% market share in china. He has something to offer to deal with the recession. Baidu was founded at the beginning of 2000. Back then they had no viable business model. Initially they wanted to sell the back end search technology to portal companies in China. But they still weren't profitable. They were too optimistic about the internet in China: at that time there were only 10 million users. Portal companies didn't want the best technology, just the cheapest.

He decided to change business model so that his better technology would be better appreciated. In 2001 they became a customer oriented website. In the past 8 years they have exsclusively focused on Chinese search technology. He went back in engineering as a project manager to make sure they had the best Chinese search technology.

In 2005 they went public at 27$. The first day ended at 122$. It was a miserable day for him because it wasn't prepared to deliver results that matched that price. "I had no choice so I pit my head down and started focusing on technology operations and user experience". Baidu now answers more queries in China than Google does in the us. More Chinese internet users than the us population. "The us will never be able to catch up".

How to deal with difficult times. You need to be realistic, pragmatic. Once you find out what you need to do, you need to stay focused. In the last years they have done the same thing: focused on what they are good at.

On twitter you follow people, on postbar you follow topics for each query. Conventional search engines only index 1% of the web. People can submit their pages and they include them in their results.

Consumers have high expectations about search. Its not about information anymore. Can we integrate all the various search boxes in a single box? If you are asking what lunar day it is today, you get a lunar calendar.

He envisions a world of "box computing" in which a search box is the only interface. Windows takes time to learn, but search is intuitive.

About China. 700k engineering graduates per year, but many are not experienced.

Find what you like and what you're good at. Once you find it, stick to it.

##QA

*In the first years, what were the first 3 critical strategic decisions?*

1. They brought 1.2 million $ back to China at the height of the bubble. He treated his employees worse than the other internet companies. He had told the investors the money would last 6 months, but he told his people it would need to last 12 months. After 6 months, the bubble burst but he had more than half the money in his bank account.

2. They realized the company wouldn't survive on the back end. They started to compete with all their customers. But if we don't do it, he doesn't see the company.

3. Improve his technology. Meeting twice a day with his engineer.

*What American companies don't understand about the Chinese search market?*
Tech companies have been in china for a while, but internet companies are different. They didn't realize the rate of growth of China. The amount of Chinese information on the internet doubles every year. Most of the capital comes from american vc money and helped increase the penetration of the internet.

*Have you any plans to expand in the US?*
No they have worked for 10 years on chinese and only recently launched a Japanese search engine.

Most of the marketing you did was baidu against the american companies. Traffic is king for internet companies. But spending $100m to get more traffic just doesn't work. But, as a b2c company, they needed to build up a brand. Initially, they didn't want to be associated with Chinese products. But before the IPO, they needed to communicate with the american investor why they were better. "Mostly it's the IPO, not to increase the traffic"

My advice to american companies is that they really need to have a presence to understand what is going on.
