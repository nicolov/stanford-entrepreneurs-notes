#David Hansson

*David Heineimeier Hansson, the creator of Ruby on Rails and partner at 37signals in Chicago, says that planning is guessing, and for a start-up, the focus must be on today and not on tomorrow. He argues that constraints--fiscal, temporal, or otherwise--drive innovation and effective problem-solving. The most important thing, Hansson believes, is to make a dent in the universe with your company.*

Partner at 37signals. Even though they're lumped together with the other Web 2.0 companies, they're actually profitable (laughter from the audience).

All the headlines are bad news. But right now it's the best time to come out of college. You don't have to write a bullshit resume to join the workforce. You can't just get a boring middle-management job at a consultancy anymore, you actually have to put a dent in the universe. There's nothing else to do right now than to make a splash, just don't become another manager consultant at Accenture.

This doesn't mean it's easy to start a company. But first, you need to unlearn your MBA. He spent 3 years at Copenhagen Business School, and 97% of what he learned was useless. All these tools that you've learnt, they're only for you. And they're useless when you're small. And everybody starts small. It's just irrelevant.

When you come out of business school, you're writing sucks because it's targeted at professors.

He'd say the most important asset we have at 37signals is good, human writing.

**Planning is guessing**. This leads to funny things, like startups with 5-year growth plans. Planning is not just guessing, but harmful guessing.

**Most decisions in small businesses are temporary** we're not Intel that decides to invest in factory that will take 5 years to build.

**Venture capital is a time bomb**. You get to spend other people's money for a sustained period of time, and the worst that can happen is that you loose 5 years of your life. And loosing 5 years is much better than worrying about how to pay for rent next month.

The problems with VC:

- you spend other people's money. When they hire a new person at 37signals, his dividend check at the end of the year gets smaller.

- you need an actual product with an actual price. The worst aspect of VC is that you don't have the feel of emergency, which is the most powerful motivator for entrepreneurs.

- the VC route is that *small* is a stepping stone to a $1bn business. The VC won't be happy with a business that throws off $ 1m per year. But you'd be pretty well-off if they went to your pocket.

- The biggest misconception is that if you start a company by yourself, you must be a workaholic. Their biggest revenue generator, BaseCamp, was built by him working 10hrs/week while at school for 6 months. When you work 80hr/week you do whatever needs done without thinking about what's important for your business.

When you put constaints on yourself, you have no choice to out-effort microsoft or google. The constraint forces you to do way less and different from the competition. The customers love all the things that come from doing less. Also realise that, no matter what you do, you won't be an overnight success.

##QA

He got started with a website with game reviews. To publish it, he had to learn programming. It was 1997 and got into an incubator who paid him to write articles they had no idea how to make money from. But he realized quickly it was going to only last for 18 months and resigned. Then went to work for the shittiest software company. "If you want to be an entrepreneur, finding a shitty company, and forcing yourself to work there for six months, is awesome motivation and will teach you how not to do things". The environment is very important.

He was still in Copenhagen and working with 37signals with a 7-hour timezone. They could over-collaborate and they only way they could collaborate is by gettings things done.

Rails grew out of his work on BaseCamp, a software they developed initially without any idea of selling it as product. Java or PHP wouldn't do, because he only had 10 hours/week.

Re: marketing you can "outspend or outteach" to build an audience (that may not need your product today). He believes that most successful businesses are built on word of mouth, at the end.

What did you get out of Business School? Buy for $1 and sell for $2. You need to appeal to people's self interest. People are assigning value to you by giving you money.

Salesforce gets a lot of positive press about moving software. But have you looked at their numbers? They have a 5.9% margin, which is horrible. They're a software company and they've been at it for ten years. You're doing something wrong and get the attention because people look at stupid things like revenue. It's profit that counts.

As long as you can, you should be spending your own money. Building something during the weekends is better than getting money up front.

They have no managers. They need 40 minutes of management every three days. If you hire a manager, they'll make up shit to manage to fill a 8-hour workday. That's how you end up with policies, etc.. Idle managers are the worst.

What about incubators? It's not the event itself, but the pipeline it sets you up for: build a prototype then start looking for VC. Better to get some revenue and build a self-sustaining business first.

New companies and new products can be introduces when times are not good and people are shopping around for change. When the money's rolling, you just buy IBM.

Companies that run well don't need a lot of PR. Those who want need the press to raise their next funding. Profitable companies have their heads down trying to raise their profit margins.
