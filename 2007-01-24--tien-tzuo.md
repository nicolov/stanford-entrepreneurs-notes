*Tien Tzuo, Chief Strategy Officer for Salesforce.com, describes seven lessons for transforming an enterprise software business from a traditional direct sales model to one which leverages the internet to produce in-bound sales. He stresses the awareness cycle for Salesforce.com's products, free-trial offers, onion-based product design and the continuing importance of events in the complex enterprise software industry.*

One of the first employees of Salesforce.com. Joined salesforce in 1989. No product, no customers. 18k employees now. Spent a few years at Oracle selling enterprise software. Stanford business school, then decided he’s not a banker, not a private equity guy, not a consultant, and came back to the business.

Enterprise software had gone into this mode where complexity what was rewarded. A big machine feeding itself. They felt like enterprise software was this huge stack of cards. It was clear that the internet was a transformative force. Trying to rebuild it.

For this class, let’s go through the enterprise software life cycle:

1.	How do you find out about software? Gartner reports, listen to experts. Now, you go on the web and educate yourself. Now, their strategy is about creating a buzz on the marketplace, adding dialogue. Their marketing machine basically creates a two way dialogue with the marketplace.

2.	How to get a feel for the software? Go to an event or call a sales rep over. Now, though, access to information is open. A lot of investment in content to put up on the website. Spend marketing money on the website and attract more traffic. It’s not something a lot of companies are doing. In the 90s, sales reps would give the software for you to try, but rather wanted to stage a presentation. They were trained to treat the request as a point of entry: let me set it up for you, understand what your requirements are, etc.. They wanted to offer a free trial of the product and faced two points of resistance:
	- sales rep who wanted to control the flow of information
	- excessive complexity that overwhelms the user. Instead of the old model, where really you had to design for complexity, since the presentation was scripted, now you need to build the product like an onion, with intuitive functionality up front and easy to grasp. People like to get the high level first, like the New York Times articles (3k words fill level, 10k words)

3.	What about the sales model? It’s not like buying a book, you still want to talk to people. The first instinct was to hire sales guys from Oracle. But with the internet, instead of having high power sales people, you want tele-sales who call the customer back after the trial. We now have ‘deal qualifiers’ who call the leads back immediately and try to understand which ones are likely to buy.

4. The standard marketing approach is STP, Segment, Target, and Approach. But this is not the way it works: you can’t control who comes to your website in the new environment. They quickly found out they needed to pursue all customer segments. The best way to take advantage of the web is, instead of making a lot of analyses, you just let the marketplace tell you. “Let’s call a few people back”. Setting up a website and letting people come to us led us in the direction of big businesses pretty early on.

5.	Packaging: if you’re reverse positioning (letting the marketplace come to you), their product became underpriced in some markets and overpriced in others. They left money on the table. Analogy to cars. They created a new brand in 2006. We could really squeeze a 5 series between the 3 and the 7 based on customer demand.
The role of events has changed. In the 90s, the events played a role early on in the lifecycle. Now, it’s like the Apple Store.
As a salesman, in the 90s, you close the deal, book the commission, and drop off the CD. It’s up to the customer at that point. But with the free trial, only 10% of the people were buying after the 6 months period. So post-sales became critical. They track a lot of data to predict which customers are going to stick around. If you build a model, you discover that the attrition rate has a far larger effect than the growth rate.
In-bound model instead of out-bound model. Focus on post-sales.

##QA

*How do they use data to build the sales organization?*
For 4 months, they estabilished a deadline with only web search marketing and got a clear picture of what the metrics looked like. Then, they built the sales organization step-by-step.
AppExchange has really increased their relevance in the marketplace, but it was really only a reaction to the marketplace. People were not used to customize the software, because Oracle had told them that they couldn’t upgrade if they did so.

*Isn’t the barrier to entry low?*
No, quite the contrary, we spent a lot of money on our datacenter. I disagree. They don’t have the resources for building applications for each need (HR, etc..) What they want to become is a platform where people would like to cooperate, and not fight with them.

*What about talent? Now that you’re a public company, isn’t it more financially rewarding to work for a pre-public company?*
What keeps us up at night is more opportunity-based than fear-based. We have a huge market to get hold of.
