*Shai Agassi discusses his entrepreneurial journey from the enterprise software industry to his current work in clean energy. In the process, he describes the "physics of startups", drawing parallels between principles of business and the laws of physics. He emphasizes the importance of acting on an idea before it's adopted by the mainstream and navigating the inevitable uncertainties that can result in success or failure.*

I recruited my dad from a big technology company. They were building software and were called by Apple for an educational software, which was cancelled because Apple predicted that browser penetration would only be 16% at the end of the decade. His dad called from Israel, and asked him when he was coming back. He said: “If Apple can be so dumb as to cancel this project and still 12bn, I’m staying here, I’ll do real good”. They had 5 projects with 2 years of runway (5 millions). Within three days, all of them were canceled. They were able to raise 1 million and 1 ½ years later sold the company for 110 millions. He sold it again to SAP for 400 millions. 10 years later, he was managing 1.5 bn for SAP as the head of development and a 33 year-old Israeli board member among 50 year-old Germans.

Then he decided he would be very disappointed if he only did software, so resigned. The distance between success and failure is very thin, you could have been so close to being a superstar and not knowing. After the contracts were cancelled, he called the lifeline (a project manager friend at Apple) and angels started showing up. One of them started the meeting saying he was never going to work with Israeli. Midway through, he started going like ‘I love golf, I love golf’. He had retired three times, but put up as much money as needed on the condition that he would become CEO of the company and take 10%. And they had to move to Monterey close to where he lived.

What does money mean to you? Money is like air, if you go into business to make money, you’re already in the wrong business. You’ll sense money when you don’t have it, in the other moments it doesn’t count. “There’s only one guy who’s going to be very very happy when you make a lot of money, that’s your private banker”

He went to raise money, and VCs offered 6.6 millions. A friend then told him to go to Bonne to sit in in a meeting for him, a Dutch SAP competitor. They were supposed to sign with the VCs on Friday, and were ordered not to discuss investments. But they went like ‘I know you’re raising capital with the VCs” “8 million” “naah” “10 million” “12” “I’m not here to raise capital” Then he writes 14 on a piece of paper, says he has one hour and leaves the room. Unfortunately he has a very high integrity factor. He comes back to the valley, it’s friday, the VC calls and says “the stock market went down 10%, we’re taking it down from 6.6 to 6. Same share of the company.” “I have an offer from Bonne” “Come to my office, we’ll sign for 6.6” Now I understand what the rules of the game are, and went with 14millions. When you build the plan, factor your optimism in: if you think you need 10, you really need 100.

One thing they did is using gravity to grow, like NASA sending spaceships. You need to figure out whose giant shoulders you’re on.

They invented a new product for Bonne, an enterprise portal. They showed them all the documents, etcc. After a couple of months, they came back with the beta, and Bonne said they had decided to build them on their own. We had an agreement. “There’s not contract”. “We showed you the specifications” “We could have come up with the specifications ourselves”. Two weeks later, he went to visit the CEO of SAP. “What are you, stupid? We already showed it to Bonne”. Now a 1bn business for SAP.

Just about when Bonne was starting to spiral down, the employees told him they were worried about the future, he thought the company was in the best shape it ever was. Employees see kinetic energy, they sit on the ball and see the speed of the ball. CEOs see potential energy.” You have to remember, that There’s a big discrepancy between these those two perceptions of the world. I saw the beginning of the relation with SAP. They saw the end of the work we were doing with Bonne”.

Where should I focus on? How many people have a business plan with Web 2.0 in it? If it’s already on Wired, it’s already too late. No surfer catches the back of the wave. Noone takes the back of the wave, because the energy is already gone. “All of the great companies in the SV started out in a downturn. You couldn’t get a job anywhere else.” 

He was offered the role of CEO of SAP and refused. The reason is, when he joined the young economic leaders project, he was asked a question you should disallowed to ask to people between the ages of 37 and 41. “What are you going to do to make the world a better place in 15 years?” An extreme accelerator of mid-life crisis. Second was “What are you really the best at in the world?” I’m good at taking a big problem and solving it.

In Israel, if your car is driving outside the country, it’s probably been stolen. They want to create a profitable model to get Israel off fuel, then expand to London. We want to replicate the point in history when oil was useless, after the light bulb was invented. Analogue to Edison/Tesla/Westinghouse in the first revolution. Westinghouse has the right business model that allowed it to light up block after block.
