*CEO and co-founder Aaron Levie launched Box.net in 2005 with the goal of helping people to access, collaborate, and share their content online. Box has grown into the leading cloud content management solution for over 4 million users and companies ranging from small businesses to Fortune 100 companies.*

5 million users. 130 employees in Palo Alto. Enterprise technology today sucks. They built a superior technology which is cheaper, better, more connected.

2005: Why should you carry around a thumb drive? The email provider at his school provided 50MB of online storage (and deleted everything after 6 months). They saw an huge gap in the market.

Factors:

1. cheaper storage
2. increase in remote workforce, people want to work from anywhere

Bring to the masses stuff that geeks already do.

They launched the beta from their dorm room. They needed financing to finance growth. They decided to open up the product for free (1GB in 2006).

Their business model changed daily (ad-supported, licensing the technology, etc..)
They focused on customers that could pay for the technology. Businesses altready spend billions of dollars in file sharing technology. But conventional enterprise software companies release the software in three-year cycles. They could be more like consumer companies.

The shift worked. Almost overnight, they could charge 10 to 100 times more. They had a sales model in which people actually called them (due to the free version). By the time they’re talking to someone on the phone, they’re already educated about the product. They already know it’s the right product for them.

“Crossing the chasm”

It’s easy to get early adopters on tech crunch, but to get to the bigger, more conservative businesses, you need to build a much bigger organization.

Support for Zappos. When you want to talk to someone in enterprise software, you always feel like they’re selling, not talking to you.

1. “People are literally underwriting our ability to change the world, and not taking advantage of that is a complete waste. Silicon Valley is the Disney Land of capitalism.”

2. Do something that wasn’t possible to four year ago.

3. Do something that you’re passionate and inspired about

4. Don’t compromise. You don’t have to compromise on who you work with or which technology to use.

Just don’t go work for McKinsey or something like that.
