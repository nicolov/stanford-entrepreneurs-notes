*John Roos, CEO of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, has represented many major Silicon Valley companies during mergers and acquisitions, initial public offerings, strategic alliances, and joint ventures. In this lecture, he describes many of the lessons he's learned since joining the firm in 1988, including building a brand, taking risks, and the importance of integrity.*

Didn’t realize a lot things were happening in the Silicon Valley, and instead left for Los Angeles for practice law, where his girlfriend was living at the time. Having no clue of what was really going on in the Valley. In 1985 he woke up to what was going on in the Valley. Joined a high tech law firm with around 50 employee. Best decision he had made in his life.

The law firm has a very simple mission, as you need to adapt in your life: being the leading firm for biotech and emerging growth technologies. Go with your core strenghts, what you know best, etc.. despite people advising to become a diversified law firm.
In any kind of business you are building a brand. They decided to build the best brand of the world in representation of tech companies. They also have a very simple strategy (3 circle) in represent the company from day one to multibillion:

1. venture backed company, option work. Most work is non-legal, advice, network
2. because of a lot of new regulations after Enron, it is much more difficult to go public. For this reason the simplest exit strategy is selling to a big public company. The second circle is the small public company (up to a billion in value). Now they do much of their high-margin legal work because they know them.
3. Billion+ company

Companies succeed when they have a clear mission statement, a clear strategy, and a brand, and they stick to it.

The Silicon Valley is built on merit and diversity. “You can take an idea from day one, from that first circle, and you can work hard, dream big, and make it happen, and noone will pre-judge no matter what age you are no matter where you come from”.
Etnic diversity? Failure is not a stigma. It is a situation where not taking the risk is a bigger failure than not taking the risk.

The ecosystem is amazing and extends way beyond the valley. There definetly is a set of player in the valley that you should get to know. 2k-3k private companies and 2-300 public companies. Everyone feeds on each other. There are certain ways the legal work is done, then when it comes to venture capital, they don’t understand the capital structure. It would be nice just to have a cookie cutter thing that just takes this issue off the table.  “There’s just a way of doing things in the valley that if you’re starting a company you really want to tap into.”

The one thing that keeps constantly changing is the industry itself, and what we are working on. 1970s -> bricks and mortar of tech (semiconductor) 1980s -> computers. The cover of the Time magazine was “Has the Silicon Valley gone bust?”. I remember thinking of having done this great move. It would seem like the best days were behind us. Then it came the 90s. We were talking about the industrial revolution. The building blocks of sound management were out of the window. We knew it was just a cycle. Described this era as digital - mobile - personal - virtual (infrastructure, geography doesn’t matter). The firm is involved in clean energy phenomenon.

Lots of great technology coming out of Israel, especially about security. The Silicon Valley is global, but what happens is that a lot of people come here, get experience, build a company, then go back.

1. Take risk
2. Don’t be afraid to take a step back if you think it will be a step forward in the long run. Came back from LA as a litigator and they wanted to hire him as such, he would become partner in a few years. If you want to do corporate, you start over.
3. It takes 10 hands to make a basket.
4. The best CEOs in the valley let everyone reach for the stars
5. Little things matter. Execution matters.
6. Integrity.

We routinely say: we’ll work for you until you get founded. Many of the big LA firms won’t do that because their economic models don’t allow that. A tremendous of biotech, wireless and security tech.

Chinese, Indian and Israeli companies don’t operate under the same rules as US companies. Like intellectual property. Things will change, you’ll have to play by the international rules. Many chinese companies are incorporated offshore not to be subjected by Chinese rules. A lot of foreign money coming in because Venture Capital is less developed.

1.	we know the venture capitalists, here’s how you issue stock options
2.	chinese regulators are now building securities laws coherent with the US
3.	experience with mergers and acquisition
We have a lot people from India, China, who came here, built a company and want to live back home. That’s the primary reason people are going off to China.
