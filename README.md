# Notes on the 'Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders' by Stanford

For the last 10 years, the Stanford Entrepreneurship Corner has been organizing fantastic sessions with foremost entrepreneurs in the Silicon Valley. They have also been recording these meetings and publishing the podcasts on their [website](http://http://ecorner.stanford.edu/podcasts.html).

## What's in this repo

This repo contains my notes about the podcasts and the stories I've found the most interesting. I'm posting these here in the hope that, in some ten years time, someone will be researching the history of Silicon Valley.
