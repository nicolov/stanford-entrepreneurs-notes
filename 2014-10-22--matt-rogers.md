*Nest Co-Founder Matt Rogers explains why careers can be made on taking on the challenges and projects unloved by others. Rogers discusses what he learned working at Apple on the original iPod and iPhone, the importance of not chasing the money when raising capital, and how he and Nest Co-Founder Tony Fadell went about building an innovative consumer electronics company.*

Doing a robotics competition in high school made him realize that you can build technology that has an inprint in the real world.

He interned at Apple, paying off the technical debt in the iPod manufacturing process. Then he started working at Apple and was assigned to the (5-people) iPhone team at the time. The most important thing I learned: how to lead programs.

He had his dream job in his dream company and then he left. Family members would call him and tell him he was crazy to leave a great job. Now, they are his biggest supporters.

He bought an house and realize that houses haven't really changed from the 1970s. A grand vision alone is difficult to pitch to investors though. So they pitched a company based on building thermostats.

In 2009 they were looking at products in the home. It turns out, that heating and cooling are 50% of an house energy. It's more than all the nuclear plants in the US produce. But no one was paying attention to this problem. They realize they could build a company around that, then build on that to create a platform.

They mis-planned by around an order of magnitude. But they had great investors.

	Don't chase the money. The money's not important. What's more important is the people you work with.
	
##QA	

*Why didn't you build your startup within Apple?*
It may take a long time to build a $1bn company, how much patience is Apple going to have? When you are a $50bn company, a $10m project doesn't really get you excited.

*How did you start the company? Did you go to VC and pitch?*
They did a lot of market research in people's homes. Then they started pitching the first employees. At some point they decided they had enough meat in the bones to talk to investors.

*Do you emulate Apple?*
Design, deep technological innovation. They wanted to change the culture and have a complete transparent culture.

He and the co-founder basically founded the company for the first 12 months, besides the sweat equity put in by everyone who didn't get paid in the early days.
