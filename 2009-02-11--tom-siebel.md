*Tom Siebel, founder of Siebel Systems and current CEO of First Virtual Group, recaps a history of the information technology boom, and pronounces it a nearly stagnant sector. He focuses on the burgeoning interests in energy, healthcare, food and water, and other market possibilities to meet the needs of an expanding, aging, and more affluent global population.*

Wants to talk how to go from IT to Energy Technology. In the past decades, government policies were very favourable. Risk was seen as a business problem, not as anathema. The IT market grew at a 17% rate yoy from 1980 to 2000. You just needed to show up and not goof it up. After 2000, IT has been growing only 3%, about the same rate as the economy. Most stuff in IT is not interesting these days. It’s not the raw material from which great opportunities arise.

What’s going to happen until 2030?

-	the government regulation pendulum is going to swing back
-	unbelievable population growth (energy, food,..) Traditionally, companies have done really good banking on population trends (baby boom). A lot of aging people now. Right after I graduated, I went to Silicon Valley because it was where the action was. right now, that’s what I would do, I would get on a boat and go to Shangai, because it’s crazy out there.
-	85% of health care spending in the US is spent in the last year of life
-	energy: building consume 40% of energy in the US, 60% of the particolate. Decided to start a global challenge with 20 millions in prizes, because he thinks challenges with prizes spur innovation. They built a reference home. The challenge is building a neutral-emission house at a price equal to conventional building.
-	Another initiative is enterprise software to help companies track and measure their carbon footprint.
