*SecondMarket Founder and CEO Barry Silbert thinks his online marketplace for trading alternative assets can play an important role in creating a new model for capital markets. In this lecture, Silbert explains his personal path into entrepreneurship and describes the current growth of his firm, which has drawn attention for trading private stock in companies such as Facebook and Twitter. Silbert also offers reasons for why he thinks current public markets are broken and his vision of a new way forward.*

Turn an excel spreadsheet in a 150 million $ business.

Graduated in 1998. Involved in trading baseball cards. Youngest stock broker (17 yrs old). Then went to work in an investment bank.

Baseball cards were his first exposure to illiquid assets. In that market, the price was fixed, a couple of people always seemed to know the prices in advance. Appreciation for the need for transparency. It took 16 years to see that dynamic again. They got calls from bondholders of reorganized companies and they wanted to get rid of them. 
He was a bored banker and left to create a business. He did an investment bankers version of a business plan, 100 pages long. He wanted to build an awesome ebay-like platform. Then a friend told him that he didn't need technology for this business. He got going with an excel spreadsheet and a small office. For this reason, they were profitable from day one. They hadn't spent money building a platform.

They raised 3 millions at a 20 million valuation with 5 million in revenue. They were well positioned during the financial crisis.

In 2007 a Facebook employee called to sell his stock. They found a lot of buyers willing yo buy the stock without any information. They realized there's a big market and started selling private stock.

Historically, companies have gone public for 4 reasons:

- raise capital - liquidity for shareholders - have a currency to pay employees - branding

Private markets can address the first three points. Over the last 10 years the IPO markets has been dying. The companies that are going public are much larger than before.

Venture Capital, for being industry that loves to disrupt other companies, does not like to be disrupted. A 10-year IPO doesn't work anymore, especially when the fund life is 7 years.

It's probably the unintended consequences of some well-intended actions:

- people moving from stock brokers to online trading firms. Brokers used to push small stocks and calling prospective investors. 
- moving from 1/8 increments to pennies meant wall street has less money to pay analysts  
- regulation has made it much more difficult for a company to go public. Also forbids investment banks to pay analysts from the proceeds of the inv banking activity. So research moved to the big companies.

It now takes 10 years for a company to go public. It works for no one. In 1970, the average stock holding period was 5 years. Now, it is 2.5 months.

He believes public markets are broken. The big markets are not focused on helping the small companies.
