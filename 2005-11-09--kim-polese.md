*Kim Polese, CEO of SpikeSource, describes her twenty years of experience in developing software in Silicon Valley including Java development with Sun Microsystems. She also discusses SpikeSource's relationship with the open source community.*

Biochemical major, the CS for one year before going to the Silicon Valley in 83. Twice in her career the technology was too innovative for the market. The developers discovered Java applets, and made it was it is today. First delivered software as a service in 1995.
Years later, the infrastructure (broadband) was there, and lots of experienced entrepreneurs after the bubble burst.

Now building software for managing open-source infrastructure (when Ballmer was talking about ‘get the facts’).

SugarCRM, content management, system management companies are taking open-source software. “the world needed a low-cost, good-enough CRM software, small and medium businesses had been struggling with this”.

For enterprises, open source means no vendor lock in. 
People say we’re in a bubble. I wouldn't say we’re in a bubble yet, just a mild frenzy phase.
DNA mapping: innovate, open up the interface.

Automated testing framework (30.000 nightly tests with different OS). Encourage the community to contribute tests. It’s a different way of building a company (actively encouraging the community).

What’s different in Web 2.0:

- creating a community (like Amazon: consumer reviews)
- giving back to the community
- it’s about the data, less about IP you want to lock down
- Increasingly, software is delivered as an hosted service. Before, huge and complex software supported a community of consultants, and the compelxity was on the customer’s side. Investors love this too, as we switch to a recurring revenue instead of up-front. Make up in quantity because of the web as the distribution model.
- the value of the long tail. More and more, the value is in the 20%
- the rise of good enough computing. Open source is attractive because it is stripped down. Also linked to perpetual beta.
- importance of PR. 20 years ago, you had to go to the consultants (Gartner) because it was they who told the customer what was good and what was not. Now, it’s an influential blogger or an open-source contributor.
- building a global operation in day 1 is a must

What hasn’t changed:

- the importance of the team
- getting a channel up and running
- focus on the pain, solve someone’s problem. People get too hang up on the technology
- sequence is key. figure out where the leverage points are.

It’s a great time to start a company now. Don’t be afraid to ask people who have done this before. Never give up, failure is the best lesson.
In this age of transparency, your reputation matters more than ever.
Opensourcing a product can mean more revenue in hardware sales (example: Digium with asterisk). Core vs context topic.

What’s the opportunity in enterprise software. Solving a business problem, offering it as a service.
