*Tom Kelley, general manager at the world-renowned design firm, IDEO, presents five core practices that enhance creativity. Through entertaining stories and examples, he describes how these techniques help us all become more innovative in every aspect of our lives and lead to more success.*

The talk is about staying young at heart. His favourite book about innovation is “Orbiting the giant hairball” by Gordon McKenzie. In the book, the author tells the story of his coming in a school, starting at kindergarten in the morning and then moving up to the 6th grade. Each time, he asks the class how many people are artists. In kindergarten, everyone raises two hands. In 6th grade, only two people do, and look around to see if they’re being judged by their peers.

It’s ok to be an artist. His wife, a Japanese immigrant used to tell him that he bahaved like a child. Looking back, he now thinks she meant it as a criticism. He regarded it as an high compliment. In English, we have a distinction between child-like (which is always positive) and childish, which means selfish.

He came up with 5 habits:

1.	Think like a traveller, like when you’re in a hyper-active state of mind. Yogi Berra: “You can observe a lot by watching” Keep track of your ideas (what surprised you, what disappointe you, what seemed weird). In the CDG airport, they have turnstiles to take the train to the city. He spent 15 minutes whatching how people crossed them with baggage, and noone made it on the first try. There were people working there and noone had noticed that issue. “And I don’t think it’s because they’re frenchpeople”. “I’m not sure who discovered water, but I’m sure he was not a fish”. Observation and go out in the field. OralB called them to design a new kid toothbrush because they wanted to be different. They wanted to do field-testing, whereas OralB wanted them to just start designing, it’s a toothbrush, not rocket science, just start designing. At the time, kid toothbrushes were just shorter and skinnier versions of those for adults. But they observed 5-year olds brushing their teeth and noticed they did not have the dexterity and just needed a fatter toothbrush, not a skinnier one. They designed what became a best-seller for 18 months.

2.	Treat life as an experiment. Going to a bookstore and finding a 300 pages book can be intimidating, but if you decide to just start reading a few pages, it stops being so. The idea is to “fail forward”. Thomas Edison is considered a prolific inventor, but he had a pile of failures. He considered them as “I’ve found 10000 ways of doing things that do not work”. WD40 is another example, because the first 39 formulas failed.

3.	An attitude of wisdom: Sitting on laurels must not have been good even back then when they had them: the emperor remained emperor for life but was killed one month later… Mark Twain: “it’s not what you don’t know that gets you into trouble, but what you know that ain’t so.” Story about Best Buy who acquired a company with 3000 audio cd and dvd stores across america in 2001. Napster had already started happening since 2 years or so, but they were overconfident in their knowledge of the market. No 18-30 year olds were buying cds anymore, but they were their own employees, and the information hadn’t filtered up to the management team.

4. tips:
	- Use you own brain. There are lots of opportunities for your right brain to make its mark. Medical research into epiphanies is showing that it really is the back of the mind processing in the background. You really need to take some time to daydream. The audiobooks he was listening to a lot were taking out his ability to daydream, so he cut them a lot.
	- Find your muse. Which kind of music lets you work better? Do you work best at certain times of the day? They created “museums”, houses of the Muses.

5.	Find your passion. because you’ll be better. Mentions Collins (written Good to great and Built to last): think about 3 circles. The first is “what you’re good at. But watch out because in this circle lives the curse of competence. The second “what you’re born for” The third is what are people going to pay you to do. Most questions by the audience were about the second circle. Try writing a lab notebook on yourself noting when you’re the happiest. The best achievement in life is to blur the line between work and play.
