#2007-02-07 Reid Hoffman

*In this candid entrepreneurial narrative, Reid Hoffman describes his journey from academia to PayPal, to finally founding the professional networking site LinkedIn. Hoffman suggests that to be a successful entrepreneur you have to take risks where others wouldn't and be willing to deviate from the beaten path.*

Master’s Degree in Philosophy, then realized he was more interested in being a public intellectual. Think of entrepreneurship as investing. There are three kinds of investment strategies:

1.	sure bets where you have some kind of edge, such as information. It’s not really applicable to entrepreneurship
2.	low risk management (business school, consulting) I’ve found that consulting backgrounds and MBAs are negative predictors for successful entrepreneurship. Those place attract low-risk people.
3.	Contrarian thinking.

It’s not success to raise money, it just gives you a longer runway, and the bar at the end is higher.

Some principles:

-	work as if you’re going to succeed but plan on the fact that you may actually fail. You want to get to your failure points and measure them as early as you can. I see people spending years on failed ideas for the fear of driving them to the ground.
-	time matters. There’s a market readiness for when an idea is good. Take Youtube, there had been a lot of video sharing sites. Some of it is just luck. If your time cycles are long, the number of times you have to have the luck to catch the wave is small.
-	it’s about controlled risk. If you think you’re taking no risk, you’re either doing nothing or deluding yourself.
-	you solve the easiest, simplest problem that’s valuable. You’re not trying to prove how smart you are, how hard of a problem you can solve. Those are academics here.

He left Oxford and decided to come back to the Silicon Valley to do startups. The VCs asked me for my work experience, and told me to come back after having proved to be able to develop professionally.

There are basically 3 skill types for the founding team:

1.	technologist
2.	product person
3.	general manager

Product person is usually either the technologist or the general manager, one of whom owns the product vision.

They asked me which type I were. I went to Apple to learn how to ship software, then to Fujitsu for general management. Started his first company in 1997, the startup returned its money to the investors but didn’t very well.

-	The problem was financing strategy, which is central. At a time when their competitors were raising 40mln, they tried to raise 5mln for a subscription dating service with a solid business model, and tried to make it work. In excited capital markets, it’s hard if all your competitors are over-capitalized and you aren’t.
-	In retail, they have location, location, location. In consumer internet, you have distribution, distribution, distribution. Without distribution (users), technology has no value. When you work at big companies, you have channels of customers already.
-	you should focus on learning how to go from v0 to v1

Then Peter Thiel called him with a great new idea, encryption on mobile phones. They thought they had solved a very difficult problem, but I had already done that mistake: there was no business model. He joined the board. Since no one would build on their encryption platform, they switched to cash on mobile phones. How to go to market quickly? Use the palm pilots to split the restaurant tab -> then sync with email -> email payments look good. No one had banking experience, and asked them: “What do you do with chargebacks? What are chargebacks?”

One of the problems they solved was to have the federal government agree that they were not a bank. Test you hyphotesis, but don’t solve all your problems at once. You want to get to the biggest risk as soon as possible. For us, it was: “Can we get the demand going?” On Ebay, people were paying with checks. Then they went to solve the bank problem: banks sent them regulators asking why they were soliciting deposits on Ebay. The flipside of the bank regulation was that you could compete with them without being a bank, and they’re very slow and terrible competitors. They actually acquired a company thinking becoming a bank would be a good business model.

2002 sold to Ebay. One of the thing he likes about the Internet is power to the individual. With Paypal, everybody becomes a merchant.

There are three core ideas with Linkedin:

-	Everybody’s going to become a publisher. What’s that going to mean? For professional, it is the profile
-	How to separate signal from noise? Trusted relationships. He gets business models in the mail, and dumps them right away.

We launched linkedin answers.
They built Resume v2.0 where you can easily cross-reference people and avoid lying.
One of the things they say about venture investing is “It’s like getting married on a dinner and two powerpoint pitches”.

Most careers are heading towards entrepreneurship, even in Japan. You have the same issues that a small business cares about (brand, ..). The skills learned in entrepreneurship are applicable in all career paths.

##QA

*Does having been an entrepreneur help in being a good investor?*
Not necessarily. You should be confident that if you walk away from your investment tomorrow, the idea will still be successful. If you, as a board member who spends 3 hours per week on a company, find yourself constantly lecturing your management team who spends 70 hpw at the company, either your team is moronic and you should fire them, or you have a problem with your ego.

*How did the Linkedin distribution engine go?*
It was a great time to start a consumer internet company because there was nothing else going on. It would be much harder now, because everyone’s going like ‘Invite your friends over’.

*What motivated you to leave the academic path?*
I wanted to achieve something which had a certain scale which helps make society more interesting. I knew I could move back with my parents if needed.

*Why did Myspace replace Friendster?*
Huge scaling problem, page load times reached into the minutes. The first-mover advantage was so great that they kept growing.

Viral marketing is a lot more than an email telling you to invite your friends. 6 Degrees launch was clever.

*What’s the difference between running a startup and a big company?*
As an entrepreneur you take big and focused risks. As a general manager, you need to minimize the risk of losing the concern. That’s why a lot of the structural training in the MBA is wrong for entrepreneurship.

*What about Linkedin Answers?*
We want to help people leverage their network.
