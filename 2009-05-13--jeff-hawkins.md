=======================

He had no idea what to do after college. He started working at Intel, then read a magazine issue about the brain. At the time, they had no theoretical framework to understand how the brain worked. He goes to Intel and says that they should work on that, but they refuse. No company wanted anything to do with it. So he went to MIT, and they said that there was nothing to be learned by studying the brain. That was the prevailing thought at the time.

His career in mobile computing was going well, but in 1986 he came back to the brain and started a PhD. He wrote a paper on what he wanted to work for his thesis, but they told him he couldn't do it, anywhere.

So he put a plan in place: go back to work in the computer industry and:

- learn how to do institutional change
- make a name for himself
- make money
- let the neuroscience community mature

While working on a tablet computer, he realized that in the future, everyone would have a mobile computer in their pockets. So he postponed going back to science for another 4 years.

At the time, there was no technology for mobile: processors, batteries, internet connections. He pitched to VCs and they wanted him to start a company. But he didn't want to: he says "entrepreneurs live a miserable life". They founded Palm in 1992. It was in his contract that in 4 years he could go and work on neuroscience.

They sold the company for $44m after running out of money while developing the Palm Pilot. He was now working part-time at 3Com (acquirer of Palm). They resigned after a while because they felt that Palm would fail under 3Com.

Eventually, he got to do his neuroscience. His friends (he doesn't work in a closet, he's fairly known in the neuroscience community) told him that the only way to work on neurocortical theory was to start his own Institute, which is known a fairly respected place. They had a good success on neurocortical theory, and they had to decide what to do next. The institute was acquired by Berkeley.

A definition of entrepreneur: someone who takes his passion to wherever it takes you, not necessarily by starting a company. When you start a company, things always go wrong, and if you're not passionate about what you're doing, you won't get through those tough things. You have to be really passionate about what you're doing.

There's a common belief that being an entrepreneur requires superuman effort, superlong hours. In all those years he has worked, he has been at home for breakfast and dinner with his kids. You can be effective without working hard.

Many entrepreneurs think that VCs are their enemy. On the contrary, you want to involve them as much as possible in your problems, and call them every day.

Why do you want to be the CEO? The only thing your investors can do it is to fire the CEO. They can't fire the technical founder.

"Another thing I've learned is: as much as think, at any point in time, this is the stock option that's really gonna make me wealthier or whatever, it's always the next one or the next one there's always more later on. Just worry about your passion, worry about being successful, and good things will happen. If you worry about control, and ownership, you're not gonna have a good time, you won't be successful."

When the Hanspree Springboard launched, they did online retailing. They had so many orders the system got confused and people didn't get the product they ordered or got two or three instead. They called every single one and asked them whether they were happy. It was a disaster but they went through it.

Since the day that you're born, your brain starts building a model of how the world works using all senses. It turns out there's a common algorithm underneath, that's for example why you can learn a language through vision, such as sign language. They're trying to build the first computers using this process.

After the successful Palm III and Palm Pilot, they had money in the bank to develop the Palm V. But Microsoft had set out to crush them with Windows CE. He actually started getting condolescence letters. He told his team that they would be doing what Microsoft was unable to do: build a beautiful product. Microsoft was piling up all these software features. He decided to instead add 0 new features, so that the press would have to focus on the industrial design. Any story like "Palm introduces 4 new features, Microsoft introduces 45" would have been losing anyway. The only story would be: "Palm introduces a beautiful product, Microsoft products still look awful."

The Palm V was the first consumer product to use Lion batteries. It was also designed to be screw-less, glued together instead. At the last moment, the manufacturer got cold feet and wanted to postpone the launch by 4 months to redesign the product to use screws instead. "That's where your passion comes into play". So he came back to his childhood and picked a different glue.
