*Nick Earl, Vice President and General Manager of Electronic Arts shares his thoughts on the future of the gaming market. He discusses the changing global market space, the latest generation of consoles, mobile game distribution, user generated content, social networks and EA's strategy in the online gaming space.*

In 1982, a team of two people could create a product, now it takes 100. EA Games was founded in 1982. The bulk of the business is still retail, and is going to be for many years to come. Mobile is promising (“the new hot thing”), but is completely fragmented, and can not be ignored. ⅓ of people in America playing games on mobile devices.

-	China: very difficult to create a company and take your profits out. The mitigation of this is to go online, but that is a completely different suite. 
-	In-game advertising. Will gaming evolve the way of television? Free games that have advertisements and non-free who don’t?
-	Says that they’re competing with Hollywood for 3D programmers. Envisions picture quality on par with pre-rendered movies. You can make movies cheaper that you can make movies these days. The movie and games industries are starting to merge.
-	User-generated content for the millennials, very big in creating their own content.
-	The other big change is that online getting bigger, hard for EA, the king of packaged goods.
-	Communities are popping up all over the place. 360 Live is impressive, huge number of microsoft points sold.
-	Digital distribution is here. Lots of different models, subscription or pay-per-game.
-	Micro transactions: expansions, tools, gold for real money inside MMORPG.

The big question for EA is: can we develop a game to be an entertainment hub, the way myspace is? A lot of work is going into dynamic advertising. The big opportunity no one owns right now is the console massively multiplayer game: consoles have not been able to be hooked up to one another until now.

##QA
Would you say it’s hard now to build a developing company? A year ago I would have said yes, but now with Xbox marketplace, you can fund a game out of your credit card and directly find an audience.

A lot of demographic and distribution questions have yet to be solved in the mobile space.

We’re on the verge of an evolution. It’s really expensive to make games now, and they’re thinking about ways to change the cost structure. In the future, we may see more independent games, even though it’s harder to create value for them. Unless you go a different way, low cost and low revenue, like flash games community.

Every generation of consoles tends to take on genre away from PCs (for example, first person shooter). He doesn’t see the PC and TV merging, the PC is better for creating and editing content.

Tiger Woods golf when from 30 to 120 mln/year when they introduced the analog wing for a smoother experience.
