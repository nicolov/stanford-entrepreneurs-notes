#2013-11-13 Mike Olson & Ping Li

*Cloudera Co-Founder Mike Olson shares his insights on the present landscape and possible future of big data and the data management industry. In conversation with Ping Li of Accel Partners, Olson also discusses the advantages of building a business on top of open source technologies and the many surprising benefits of competition.*

He sold his first company to Oracle. After the lock-out period expired, he started to look around for other companies to build. He found the Hadoop software and got excited by what big players like Facebook were using it for.

He spent the summer of 2007 looking for interested people and got the Series A in 2008, a week before Lehman collapsed. This was a lucky strike, as competitors wouldn't be able to raise capital and left the market open for Cloudera.

*Why do you think there was a space for building a company around an open-source technology?* Back then, all data was contained within a single big box. In the early 2000s Google, not being aware of self-imposed limitations in the relational database industry, set out and build a scale-out infrastructure to index the web.

When leaving of Oracle, he realized this distributed paradigm was completely different from what they had been doing before. Also, another two factors appeared:

- more commodity boxes available for cheap
- data started to be generated at machine scale (cell phones, etc..)

They recognized these trends.

Hadoop was created as an open-source response to the Google magic that was published in a paper in 2004. Yahoo saw an opportunity to disrupt Google and supported the product. So Hadoop was started by the competitive response of the industry against Google.

Machine learning really likes a scale-out platform like Hadoop.

The vision is that society will have to solve hard problems in the next decade: water, food, cancer. And we will using data to solve these problems. No-one thinks of this about relational systems.

More data gives information disproportionally. Just aggregating data can give more value.

Imagine aggregating data from an entire hospital: you could find that doctor X is having disproportionally better outcomes with women from 35 to 40 having a certain set of sympthoms.

Hadoop started on the side of enterprise data warehousing needs. As it started getting more security, it started to become an attractive place for data to go first. And it may also never need.

	I'm long term bullish on relational systems and relational databases. I think they'll continue to improve and evolve *and* they're so deeply knit into the enterprise infrastructure that they'll survive for a while.
	
But most of the data of tomorrow will live in this infrastructure.

*How do you describe the open-source model for Cloudera? What's the business model?*

In the early 19th century, businesses had electricity strategies (when are we going to get it, etc..) Today, no business thinks about electricity, it's just part of the landscape. He thinks this has now become true of open-source as well: you just don't think about it anymore.

How do you get paid? There are different models:

- take a mediocre project and make it better internally, as a secret project. Then sell it as any other vendor. If you do this, you surrender contributions from the community.
- version lagging.
- be a services company (consulting, etc..) But services company don't run on high margins, so there's not a lot of money left to invest on the product, and it tends to languish. (e.g. Red Hat)
- dual licensing: you can use our software as part of yours, but only if *all* your software is also open source. *It's like distributing the poison and selling the antidote.* Your relationship with the customer begins with a threat, and it's not an healthy place to be.

They create additional software to extract more value out of the open-source software.

	Look at what happened to MySQL. The fact that we didn't have a defensible IP strategy meant that at some point we couldn't continue to grow. We would attract low cost services competition from outside the U.S., just from people who recognized that there was an opportunity to come. We would, in some sense, create our own competition. I think that the only way to create a long-term independent company is to own proprietary IP. I believe that open-source is the way that platform software is going to happen. CIO want open-source infrastructure.
	
Your only choice is to adopt an hybrid strategy. Open source companies *can* get to $15-20m, but to grow past $100m, you need to have a more nuanced IP strategy than just giving everything away.

*Cloudera has created this really huge market. The problem is, when you do that you attract competition. How do you think about dealing with competitors?*

They set out to set out a company worth billions selling into a market worth tens of billions a year. There are 0 examples of a single company in a space that gets to that scale. The only way that you can make that happen is if there's a rich ecosystem of companies building and delivering value into that space. Relational databases would never have become big if had only ever been IBM System R. You need a lot of companies innovations and driving into the market. The entrance of new companies, from IBM to venture-backed ones, means that there is an opportunity.

	We've got a lot more hands banging on the drum than we ever could have created on our own.
	
Companies selling integration services for the hardware their platform sells on creates a lot more opportunity.

	The emergence of real competition has forces us to up our game.
	
*What kept you up at night in the first year at Cloudera?*

	If you are regularly sleeping through the night as a founder of a tech company, you're doing it wrong. There should always be something that's scaring the crap out of you.

	In those early days, what we knew was, we wanted to be a product company, we hadn't yet figured out what the product was going to be, we had engaged with an handful of valuable clients, and we were struggling to try to **abstract** their requirements and figure out what our unique product strategy could be.
	
The huge stressor was having enough engineering capacity to balance:

- delivering value to clients
- servicing their real-life applications
- innovating the product

The biggest challenge in the first days was figuring out what the product was going to be.

Right now, they're trying to live up to the competition they have attracted. Salesmen from big enterprise companies visit C-level executives in their homes for Christmas. He's trying to be injected into those relationships.
