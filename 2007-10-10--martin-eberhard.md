*Martin Eberhard is the Co-Founder, President of Technology and former CEO of Tesla Motors, a company that produces the Tesla Roadster, a battery-powered electric sports car. Eberhard discusses his inspiring journey of diverse experiences in building Tesla Motors. He describes the lessons he learned: from the realization of doing something meaningful to thinking an idea through and aggressively following all leads. Tesla Motors which started with two employees is now more than 250 employees strong.*

First lesson: to do something meaningful. The first company was about building ebook readers when everyone was valuing companies based on click counts. I recommend making a business plan even if noone’s going to read, because it clarifies your thinking. The breakthrough of Tesla motors was using standard Lion batteries such as those used for laptops.

Lotus required Tesla to use their highly formalized process for new cars, including marketing, technical parts and financing. There are 9 gateways and decide together whether we made through the gateway or not. “This was a huge pill to swallow for a Silicon Valley company”. On the other hand, this helped them build the company as well as the product.

Batteries are getting better at the rate of 8% per year on the past 20 years.
